## 👋 Hey, I’m John

I like drawing boxes, thinking about drawing boxes, and figuring out better ways to draw them with other people _(sometimes in code)_. These days that means working across **product design**, **prototyping**, and a bit of **frontend engineering**.

I have **12+ years of experience** designing and building digital products. I’ve spent **6+ years at Sentry** designing and scaling core product experiences, systems, and developer-focused tools. I care about craft, systems thinking, and building things that stay clear and intentional as they grow.

#### Experience

- **Sentry** (2019–Present) — Product design leadership & IC work  
- **Garmin** (2017–2019) — Product design, systems, wellness features  
- **Marlin Connections** (2013–2017) — Design + frontend in agency land  
- **Full resume (terminal)** `npx manhart-resume`
